# Sequence Number Generator

 This is a consecutive number generator.

 Plan is to develop this into a ID generator.

 ### You will need promt-sync to have the prompts work.

1. The prompt will ask for the last sequence number used. If no number exists, you can enter 0 or 1. The generator will start with the next number after the last number provided.
2. Then the prompt will ask how many numbers to provide. 
3. The numbers will be output in an array.
4. The last number will be stored in the lastSeq variable for use in later iterations if you wish.

 Stay tuned for more.
